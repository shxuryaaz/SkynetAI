## Features

SkyNetAI is a powerful, modular AI chatbot framework built for intelligent and scalable interaction with advanced language models. It combines a responsive web interface using **Streamlit** with a high-performance backend powered by **FastAPI**. SkyNetAI supports major LLMs like **OpenAI**, **Mistral**, **Falcon**, and models hosted on **Hugging Face**, enabling users to deploy domain-specific bots tailored to sectors like finance, education, or tech. It features secure `.env`-based API key management and an architecture that makes adding new models or features simple and intuitive.

## How It Works â€“ NLP & LLM Integration

SkyNetAI utilizes advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** capabilities through state-of-the-art **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Using APIs like OpenAI or Hugging Face's InferenceClient, user inputs are processed using **transformer architectures** such as GPT, Mistral, or Falcon.

These LLMs are capable of:
- Understanding natural human language with context
- Extracting relevant information from input queries
- Generating meaningful, fluent, and context-aware replies
- Adapting behavior based on selected domains like finance, tech, or general-purpose

SkyNetAI abstracts the complexity of NLP via tools like Hugging Face Transformers and exposes a clean FastAPI interface to integrate easily with frontend or other services. This makes it a great foundation for chatbot apps, knowledge assistants, and custom LLM-based tools.
